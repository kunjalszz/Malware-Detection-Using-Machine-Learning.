# Malware-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning.
 I led a project involving a dataset of 1000 instances (500
benign, 500 malware) in CSV format. By applying seven classifiers including k-NN, Na√Øve Bayes, SVM,
Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Linear Regression, we identified Decision Forest
as the standout performer with 100 percent of accuracy in malware detection. This project underscores my
expertise in machine learning, data analysis, and cybersecurity.
